/*
Depending on our view setup we need a different system. 
In case of an isometric view, or a bird view. 

The aim of these file is to provide a geometric function foundation for
more complex drawings like boxes, poligons, and more symbolic drawings like 
ventilation, pumps, etc.

This objects should be made with malloc since we don't know how many there will be? 
Maybe?

This file compiles
